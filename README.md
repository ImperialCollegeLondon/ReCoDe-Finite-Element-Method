# Numerical Simulation using Finite Element Method 

<!-- Provide a short description to your project -->

## Description

Finite Element Method (FEM) is a powerful computational method used across a wide variety of disciplines, including engineering, mathematics and earth science. It is used to solve complex differential equations and simulate real-world scenarios. This project focuses on application of Finite Element method in solid mechanics, but the teachings can be extended to other areas of study.
It provides a comprehensive, step-by-step tutorial designed to introduce users to the fundamentals of FEM and its practical implementation in Python. The tutorial takes users through all the key stages of numerical simulations, starting from domain meshing and problem discretisation, moving to solving the differential equations and finally analysing and understanding the results.  
To make the learning process intuitive, the project begins with a straightforward example that demonstrates the methodology and code implementation. As users progress, they are gradually introduced to more advanced aspects of FEM, ensuring a solid foundation and deeper understanding of this method.

## Learning Outcomes

- Develop understanding of the fundaments of Finite Element Method
- Learn how to create custom FEM code and adapt it to solve partial differential equations
- Gain familiarity with existing libraries and tools available for FEM implementation
- Develop skills to interpret solutions and effectively analyse the simulation results

## Requirements

#### Academic
To sucessfully complete this examplar the user should have basic understanding of key mathematical concepts, including linear algebra (such as matrices, vectors, and determinants) and differential equations (both ordinary and partial differential equations, linear system of equations)

Familiarity with Python programming, using existing libraries, writing functions and graph plotting.

<!-- List the system requirements and how to obtain them, that can be as simple
as adding a hyperlink to as detailed as writting step-by-step instructions.
How detailed the instructions should be will vary on a case-by-case basis.

Here are some examples:

- 50 GB of disk space to hold Dataset X
- Anaconda
- Python 3.11 or newer
- Access to the HPC
- PETSc v3.16
- gfortran compiler
- Paraview
-->

### System

System requirements:
- Python 3.11 or newer
- Paraview 4.0 or newer
- Jupyter Notebooks

Python libraries used:
- pygmsh
- numpy
- matplotlib
  
<!-- Instructions on how the student should start going through the exemplar.

Structure this section as you see fit but try to be clear, concise and accurate
when writing your instructions.

For example:
Start by watching the introduction video,
then study Jupyter notebooks 1-3 in the `intro` folder
and attempt to complete exercise 1a and 1b.

Once done, start going through through the PDF in the `main` folder.
By the end of it you should be able to solve exercises 2 to 4.

A final exercise can be found in the `final` folder.

Solutions to the above can be found in `solutions`.

## Getting Started

<!-- An overview of the files and folder in the exemplar.
Not all files and directories need to be listed, just the important
sections of your project, like the learning material, the code, the tests, etc.

A good starting point is using the command `tree` in a terminal(Unix),
copying its output and then removing the unimportant parts.

You can use ellipsis (...) to suggest that there are more files or folders
in a tree node.
